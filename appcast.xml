			<title>1.21.152</title>
			<description>## Note
* As of this version Irony supports analyze mode for HOI4. If you see any bugs in how Irony detects any definitions there please report on the issue tracker.
* Stellaris collections with patch mods are not backwards compatible with older versions. I seriously mean it; importing a collection made in v1.21 will not be recognized in say v1.20.

## Current Release Notes
* Add missing zip unicode file handling in whole collection exports (those affected might need to re-export)

## Release Notes 1.21
* Update dependencies
* Minor fixes
* Add conflict solver analyze mode only
* Add option to export hash analysis report to clipboard
* HOI4 conflict solver analyze support added (hopefully with no parser mapping errors)
* Conflict solver reset conflicts notifications, indicators and filter
* Enhance dds image handling
* Optimize binary image preview</description>
